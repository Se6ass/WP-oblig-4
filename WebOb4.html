                <p>Our aim is to increase the access to reading material for kids all over the world. Using an interactive solution,
                 kids aged 10-16 can supplement their reading through our app. The main idea behind the app is to give the user easy access
                to reading material, and for them to connect with their friends whilst reading. Knowledge is power and we seek to equip the
                children of today with the technology of tommorrow.</p>

                <p>We offer access to millions of books in our gallery, in a variety of languages. To make learning more fun, we have
                added a quiz at the at the end of each book, as well as end of chapter questions. For each correct answer to a question, the reader is given 
                points. The app also analyzes the readers level of reading through the answer they offer, using complex algorithms. 
                This way, we offer alternative reading from our library that will help strengthen the user.

                <p>Here we offer a bit of a sneak-peak into our app. The picture depicts "User library". The first row shows the users favorited books.
                    Below "favorites", we show books recommended to the user through the app, suggested either by friends or the app itself. 
                    When a book is finished and the app has performed it´s analysis of the users reading comprehension, it suggests books that will be benefitial
                    to bringing the user to the next level.</p>

             <p>
             The following picture shows some of the apps in-depth settings. Here the user can enable settings such as nightmode, enable text-readers to access
             the content, change color settings among other options. These features are added to give increased user accessibility for those who struggle with 
             bad eye-sight, users who rely on screen-readers or just to give a more comfortable viewing, adjusted to your requirements.
